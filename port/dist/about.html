          <p>
            I am a self motivated and a desciplined soul, adept at problem
            solving, critical thinking, curation and logistics. I look at life
            through rose-tinted glasses and exactly know my way around
            prgramming which makes me a modern-day wizard who writes spells that
            allow transforming the world. I believe in keeping an eye in the
            bigger picture yet striving for minute perfection. With utmost
            positivity and hope, I strive to be a gamut of growth and continuous
            learning.
